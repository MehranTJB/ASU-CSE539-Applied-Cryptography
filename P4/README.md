## RSA Project

RSA is one the most popular encryption/decryption algorithm in real world. In this project I'm going to write a code in C# and it's library to implement RSA algorithm to encrypt/decrypt input string. In this project I used Extended Euclidean algorithm and implement RSA and I used prime numbers that are greater than 200 bits to generate encryption/decryption keys.
